![Fakir](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4e615b-7d42-4cb8-81b2-7de793be8338)

This is a personal website showcasing the services, projects, and blog of the site owner.
The website provides smooth navigation between sections through a top navigation bar (Navbar).
Users can easily access any section by clicking on the relevant link in the menu.
A standout feature of this site is that each section appears smoothly when selected from the menu, enhancing user experience.
